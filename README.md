# CoronaGame

Jun 2020

Based on the real events of 2020's pandemic, CoronaGame strives to act as an educational game. Player will encounter himself inside a mall center in which he needs to keep distance from others in order to prevent a Covid-19 infection. Along the way, objects like mask and alcohol gel can be picked up to help the player exiting the mall in safety.

This game was inspired by our new day-to-day life influenced by the coronavirus.

The main objective of the game is not to be infected.
